# Predicting Credit Card Customer Churn

A machine learning project to identify customers at risk of churning based on demographic, behavioral, and financial data.

---

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn is a major concern for financial institutions, especially credit card companies. 

In this project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a credit card provider using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and transactional attributes for over 10,000 customers. 

I performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, handled class imbalance, engineered meaningful features, and trained multiple classification models including **logistic regression**, **random forest**, and **XGBoost**. 

Model performance was evaluated using **ROC-AUC**, **precision-recall metrics**, and **confusion matrices**. Feature importance analysis helped identify key drivers of churn, offering actionable insights for retention strategies. 

This project demonstrates my ability to frame a business problem, apply ML techniques, and communicate insights effectively.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Remove irrelevant fields (e.g., `CLIENTNUM`, pre-computed Naive Bayes column)
   - Handle missing values
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize class imbalance  
   - Analyze relationships between features and churn
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Log transformation for high skewed features
4. **Modeling**  
   - Baseline: Logistic Regression  
   - Tree-based models: Random Forest, XGBoost
5. **Evaluation**  
   - ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, classification report
   - Feature importance interpretation
   - Shap value visualization
6. **Insights**  
   - What behaviors indicate risk?
   - What actions can a business take?

## 📈 Results

- **Best model**:   XGBoost
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 99.2%  
- **Top churn predictors**:
